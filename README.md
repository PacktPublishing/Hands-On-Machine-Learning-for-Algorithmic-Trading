## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
interesting_times = extract_interesting_date_ranges(returns=returns)
interesting_times['Fall2015'].to_frame('pf') \
.join(benchmark_rets) \
.add(1).cumprod().sub(1) \
.plot(lw=2, figsize=(14, 6), title='Post-Brexit Turmoil')
```
